# reasoning with AI

The point of this project is to test neural network architectures against small reasoning tasks that are logic based.
This will not use LLMs but insted focus on small networks to find good small architecture that enable simple and more advaned resoning and logic.

this project migth explore planing in the future but first it will focus on supervised learning to learn the output of a given situation.
